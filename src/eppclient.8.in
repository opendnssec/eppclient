eppclient
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
eppclientd is a plugin for the OpenDNSSEC software.
It performs key updates to registries using the EPP protocol.

eppclientd reads DNSKEY RR lines from stdin. The format is:

<zone> <ttl> <class> <type> DNSKEY <flags> <protocol> <algorithm> <public key>

All lines must be for the same zone.

See RFC 4034 for details.
.SH "NOTE"
If you send new keys for a zone which has a transfer pending
(its' keys have not yet successfully been transferred),
then eppclient will remove the pending keys and only transfer the new.
